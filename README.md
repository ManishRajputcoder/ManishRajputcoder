# Hi, I’m Manish Singh 👋  
**Frontend Developer | React JS Enthusiast | Lifelong Learner**

### 💡 My Journey  
I didn’t start out as a “tech kid.” In college, coding felt like a chore — handwritten programs, never-ending assignments, and confusing error messages. But after graduation, I decided to give it another shot.  

I picked up **JavaScript** and **React** out of curiosity, started building small projects, and slowly everything clicked.  
I’ve since built clones of popular apps like **YouTube**, **Flipkart**, and **AI-powered tools**, learning something new with each project.  

Now I’m on a mission to use technology to **solve real-world problems** and build products that people love.
